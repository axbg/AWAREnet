- Presentation flow
	- 1. The first step
		- The first step we did before we chose a concrete topic was to get informed


	- 2. What can we do?
		- We tried to understand how we, as citizens, can fight against climate change and which would be the most efficient methods
	

	- 3. Something unexpected
		- But, with each new article that we read, we reached a pretty sad conclusion: it seems like, despite their best efforts, the impacts of individual citizens going green is very hard to estimate, because it's not that big at all

		- For example, almost 63% of the greenhouse gases emitted between 1751 and 2010 can be attributed to a group comprising less than 90 companies 

		- Half of these emissions took place after 1988, the year when global warming publicly became a fact


	- 4. Misleading data?
		- But, at the same time, a lot of peer-reviewed studies show that 2/3 of the same greenhouse gases are emitted by households

		- How is this even possible?	


	- 5. It's a matter of perspective
		- It's very important to understand the true meaning of these numbers because some studies consider that household emissions include the gases that were emitted during the manufacturing of most consumer goods: like cars, for example :)


	- 6. No other choice? 
		- If we look at history, the impact of individual citizens is small

		- Even today, when middle-class persons have a more significant individual impact, it's worth mentioning that most people in developed countries live in a system of actions and ideas designed by big corporations


	- 7. More options
		- Fortunately, the trend of new companies that wish to find more sustainable ways to produce their goods is ascending

		- A self-feeding feedback loop between this fact and the interest of general customers to go green started to become frequent

		- A study shows that 85% of the interviewed people shifted their preferences to more sustainable alternatives in the past 5 years


	- 8. Greenwashing
		- Because this type of advertisement is nice, and the behavior of the customers shifted towards sustainability, at least at a conceptual level, big corporations wanted to benefit from the same immaculate image, thus creating the term greenwashing

		- Greenwashing, combined with the fact that big corporations tend to increase their CO2 footprint even when they set their own goals to decrease them, show that they might not be able to handle the situation by themselves even if they wanted to


	- 9. Enter: AWAREnet
		- What if instead of spending big budgets on events that are just marketing, do not have a real impact, and do not increase the trust of their customers, the companies would redirect the same money in a transparent way to experts who, gathered in multiple organizations, know exactly what type of events to organize in order to fix real issues and reach a big number of people

		- AWAREnet, our implementation sample, is a platform that brings together organizations fighting against climate change, corporations that want, at least, to have a greener perceived image, and individual citizens interested in this topic
